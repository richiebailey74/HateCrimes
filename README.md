This project entails the construction of red-black trees and AVL trees from scratch. The program inputs hate crime data in the US over the past couple decades from CSV files into these trees. Then statistical analysis tests can be performed by the user of the program to analyze data and trends of hate crimes in the US over certain time periods. The program is also designed to demonstrate the time complexity differences between red-black trees and AVL trees.
